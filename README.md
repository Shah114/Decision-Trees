# Decision-Trees
**Decision Trees Tutorial**
**Overview**
This repository provides an implementation of Decision Trees using Python. Decision Trees are a popular machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. They work by splitting the data into subsets based on the value of input features, creating a tree-like model of decisions.

**Features**
Classification and Regression Trees: Support for both decision tree classifiers and regressors.

Gini Impurity and Entropy: Two criteria for measuring the quality of splits in classification trees.

Mean Squared Error: Criterion for regression trees.

Pruning: Implementation of pruning methods to avoid overfitting.

Visualization: Tools for visualizing the tree structure.



**Requirements**

Python 3.6 or later

NumPy

Pandas

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib (for visualization)

Seaborn
